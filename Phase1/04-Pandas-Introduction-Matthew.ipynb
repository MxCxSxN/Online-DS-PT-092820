    "Before we get into Pandas, let's talk about Numpy for a second. Numpy stands for \"Numerical Python\" and it's designed for high-level mathematical functions and computing functionality. It uses multi-dimensional arrays to store data, which is more convenient and more optimized than a 'pure' Python type. What that means is that Numpy is fast - faster than base Python. \n",
